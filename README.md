2Ô∏è‚É£ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3Ô∏è‚É£ SQL/ Python Analysis 

- In each step, show your Code

- Include query/ code execution screenshots or result samples

- Explain its purpose and its findings

  **Metric**

```power BI
Total_orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID])

Total_profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])

Total_sale = SUM(Orders[Sales])
```

```power BI
avg_delivery_time = AVERAGE(Orders[Delivery_time])
```

```power BI
avg_total_sale_all = 
 VAR total_sale =
 CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]))
 VAR total_orders =
 CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID]))
 RETURN
total_sale / total_orders
```

**PY - Previous Year**

```power BI
Total_orders_PY = CALCULATE([Total_orders], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_date[Date]))

Total_profit_PY = CALCULATE([Total_profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_date[Date]))

Total_sale_PY = CALCULATE([Total_sale], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_date[Date]))

```

**Measure**
**%change - % change vs previous year**

```power BI
%change_orders = DIVIDE([Total_orders] - [Total_orders_PY],[Total_orders_PY])

%change_profit = DIVIDE([Total_profit] - [Total_profit_PY],[Total_profit_PY])

%change_sale = DIVIDE([Total_sale] - [Total_sale_PY],[Total_sale_PY])

```

```power BI
%PF = DIVIDE([Total_profit],[Total_sale])
```

**Return metric**

```power BI
prduct_returned_count = calculate(count(Orders[Return label]),filter(Orders,Orders[Return label] = "Yes"))

Returned_Orders_count = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID]), Orders[Return label] = "Yes")

Returned_orders_sale = CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]), FILTER(Orders, Orders[Return label] = "Yes"))

%return_orders = [Returned_Orders_count]/[Total_orders]

avg_returned_orders_deliverytime = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Orders[Delivery_time]),filter(Orders,Orders[Return label] = "Yes"))

avg_returned_product_value = calculate(SUM(Orders[Sales]),Orders[Return label] = "Yes") / [prduct_returned_count]

```

 **Observations**  

1. **Overall Order & Return Performance:**  
   - Total **25.04K orders** were placed.  
   - The **return rate is 4.68%**, indicating a moderate level of product returns.  

2. **Sales & Returns by Sub-Category:**  
   - Some sub-categories like **Binders, Storage, and Paper** have **high return rates** (Binders: 1,422 returns, Storage: 957 returns).  
   - **Tables and Chairs** also show significant returns in terms of value.  
   - High sales sub-categories like **Copiers, Phones, and Appliances** appear in the "Returned Product" section, suggesting issues in these categories.  

3. **Returned Product Impact:**  
   - The total value of returned orders is **$819.02K**.  
   - The **average product value** for returns is **$268.53**, indicating that costly items are being returned.  
   - The **average delivery time** for returned products is **3.91 days**, slightly lower than the **3.97-day average for all products**, suggesting potential quality or fit issues rather than late deliveries.  

4. **Top-Selling Products:**  
   - **Hoover Stove and Hoover Toaster** are among the best-selling products.  
   - Kitchen appliances dominate the top-seller list.  

5. **AOV (Average Order Value) and Profit:**  
   - Total sales are **$12.64M**, with an **AOV of $504.99**.  
   - Profit varies across sub-categories, with some high-AOV categories also showing moderate profits.  

---

 **Recommendations**  

1. **Reduce Return Rates for Key Sub-Categories:**  
   - Investigate **why Binders, Storage, and Paper** have high returns (quality, misleading descriptions, shipping issues?).  
   - Improve product descriptions, quality checks, or packaging for these categories.  

2. **Address High-Value Returns:**  
   - Since **Tables, Chairs, and Appliances** contribute to high return values, analyze reasons (defects, customer dissatisfaction, incorrect specifications).  
   - Consider stricter return policies or better customer education on product specifications.  

3. **Leverage Best-Selling Products:**  
   - The **Hoover brand (Stove, Toaster)** performs well‚Äîconsider increasing stock or launching promotional campaigns to boost sales.  
   - Look into bundling kitchen appliances to increase overall basket size.  

4. **Optimize Delivery & Customer Support:**  
   - Since return delivery times are short, ensure customer feedback is analyzed for patterns (wrong item sent, damages, missing parts).  
   - Improve post-purchase support for expensive products to reduce returns.
