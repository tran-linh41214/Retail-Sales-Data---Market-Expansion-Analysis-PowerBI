## 📌 Background & Overview  

### Objective:
### 📖 What is this project about? 
 
This project analyzes global sales performance using Power BI. The objective is to:

- Minimize losses by analyzing return trends
- Support data-driven decision-making for product strategy  

### 👤 Who is this project for?  


✔️ Sales Manager  
✔️ Marketing Manager  
✔️ Customer Service Department  / Customer Experience Department

###  ❓Business Questions:  

✔️ What are the top-performing products and regions for sales growth?  
✔️ Which products have the highest return rates, and why?  
✔️ How can sales trends help optimize market expansion strategies?  
✔️ What factors contribute to revenue fluctuations across different segments?

### 🎯Project Outcome:  
✔️ **Sales Performance:** The United States dominates in sales, with New York City leading in both revenue and profitability. Other high-performing cities include Seattle, Sydney, and San Francisco.

✔️ **Product Insights:** Technology (Phones & Copiers) drives profit in NYC and Seattle, while Bookcases perform well in Sydney. San Francisco stands out for Office Supplies, especially Art, Labels, and Envelopes.

✔️ **Return Rate Analysis:** NYC has a lower-than-average return rate, making it a high-potential market for growth. Other regions should adopt best practices to reduce returns and increase customer satisfaction.

✔️ **Regional Growth Potential:** Seattle has strong profit potential in Copiers, while Sydney excels in Furniture. Targeted expansion strategies can further boost revenue.

## ⚒️ Main Process

1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cc974b0-abd0-49ce-a03d-e84384146e7c)

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3️⃣ SQL/ Python Analysis 

- In each step, show your Code

- Include query/ code execution screenshots or result samples

- Explain its purpose and its findings

  **Metric**

```power BI
Total_orders = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID])

Total_profit = SUM(Orders[Profit])

Total_sale = SUM(Orders[Sales])
```

```power BI
avg_delivery_time = AVERAGE(Orders[Delivery_time])
```

```power BI
avg_total_sale_all = 
 VAR total_sale =
 CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]))
 VAR total_orders =
 CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID]))
 RETURN
total_sale / total_orders
```

**PY - Previous Year**

```power BI
Total_orders_PY = CALCULATE([Total_orders], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_date[Date]))

Total_profit_PY = CALCULATE([Total_profit], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_date[Date]))

Total_sale_PY = CALCULATE([Total_sale], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Dim_date[Date]))

```

**Measure**
**%change - % change vs previous year**

```power BI
%change_orders = DIVIDE([Total_orders] - [Total_orders_PY],[Total_orders_PY])

%change_profit = DIVIDE([Total_profit] - [Total_profit_PY],[Total_profit_PY])

%change_sale = DIVIDE([Total_sale] - [Total_sale_PY],[Total_sale_PY])

```

```power BI
%PF = DIVIDE([Total_profit],[Total_sale])
```

**Return metric**

```power BI
prduct_returned_count = calculate(count(Orders[Return label]),filter(Orders,Orders[Return label] = "Yes"))

Returned_Orders_count = CALCULATE(DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Order ID]), Orders[Return label] = "Yes")

Returned_orders_sale = CALCULATE(SUM(Orders[Sales]), FILTER(Orders, Orders[Return label] = "Yes"))

%return_orders = [Returned_Orders_count]/[Total_orders]

avg_returned_orders_deliverytime = CALCULATE(AVERAGE(Orders[Delivery_time]),filter(Orders,Orders[Return label] = "Yes"))

avg_returned_product_value = calculate(SUM(Orders[Sales]),Orders[Return label] = "Yes") / [prduct_returned_count]

```

📌 Analysis 2:   
- Observation: _Describe trends, key metrics, and patterns._  
- Recommendation: _Suggest actions based on insights._

Office Supplies profit cao nhưng AOV thấp => cần tăng bán kèm để nâng giá trị đơn => khuyến mãi product bán được ít trong category office supplies, các chương trình giảm giá khi mua kèm.
(Appliance đang có profit và AOV khá cao => có thể bán kèm các sản phẩm giá thấp hoặc bị trả lại nhiều (binder, art, paper), hoặc tặng kèm khi mua appliance.)

Furniture profit thấp, AOV cao => tăng profit => tìm cách giảm chi phí (thu hẹp thị trường), tăng giá bán 
Table: sale thấp trong khi tỷ lệ bị trả hàng cao => tìm nhà cung cấp khác hoặc bỏ mặt hàng này

Technology vừa có profit vao và AOV cao => tập trung vào category này
Trong Technology: Copier vừa có AOV cao vừa có profit cao, trong đó Hewllet copy machine là dòng máy bán chạy nhất

---

 **Recommendations**  

1. **Reduce Return Rates for Key Sub-Categories:**

   - Improve product descriptions, quality checks, or packaging for these categories.  

2. **Address High-Value Returns:**  
   - Since **Tables, Chairs, and Appliances** contribute to high return values, analyze reasons (defects, customer dissatisfaction, incorrect specifications).  
   - Consider stricter return policies or better customer education on product specifications.
